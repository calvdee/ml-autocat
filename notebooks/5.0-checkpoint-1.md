## Overview
* Classify products as belonging to one of seven categories
* Currently only using aggregate product statistics as features
* Severe class imbalance exists across categories

## Models
* Evaluated 3 models using F1-score:
    * KNN
    * SVM
    * Random Forest
* The KNN model suffers from extremely high variance but performs best on the cross validation set w.r.t recall
* The SVM and random forest models suffer from high variance and high bias
* The random forest model fails to correctly identify any products belonging to the Frozen category and has less diversity in misclassification error (more instances misclassified as Packaged Grocery than other models)

## Next Steps / Considerations
* Tune models with finer parameter grids
* Error analysis - what do the misclassifications look like?
* Feature engineering - will text features to improve classifications?
* Qualitative anlysis - how feasible is it for a user to look through a list to identify misclassifications ranked by confidence to improve the model?
